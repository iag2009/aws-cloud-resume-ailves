# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

This is my attempt at a cloud resume challenge project. The project was published by Forrest Brazeal, and it's a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate fundamental skills to pursuing a career in Cloud. I came across Rishab Kumar's implementation on the Internet and made my own implementation based on Forrest and Rishab.
